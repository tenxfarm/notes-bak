## Perimeter Protection

A wall is better, but it is expensive. So we will have to start with fencing. Not sure how much protection it will provide. And whether it can keep stray animals, rodents at bay. 

## CCTV Cameras

To start with we can just use $5 IP Cameras. It won't have cloud backup.

There are also some tutorials on easily making an arduino or raspberry pi camera connected to dropbox.

## Operations Manager Staying at the Farm

I will need to think about this. There are many issues that can happen during the initial stages of the farm. A person or a few people staying at the farm location itself is a good way to mitigate escalating disasters. OH farms and others utilize this model, where they subsidize the stay, food for the farm hands. And in return they can reduce the salary as well as get protection for the farm. 

But doing so will be an initial capex burn as at least a livable space with some appliance, toilets, furniture will need to be made. And these might require additional approvals/procedures. 

Either a container converted to office space come living space or a small quarters needs to be built. Anyway toilets as part of [[amenities]], will need to be made for the workers and visitors. This is where the Regis model of having an [[Operations]] building (which can have office space, storage for documents/files, meeting room that doubles as event room in case of visitors or school trips etc.) makes a lot of sense. 

But the initial capex burn is something we can't afford right now and hence we have to put that on hold.
