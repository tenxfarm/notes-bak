Fish provides the nutrients for the plant. 

Source for fish is hatcheries. Fish need oxygen/[[Aeration]]. Choose a fish local/native to your area, as it is more likely to survive. And you won't need additional resources (electricity etc.) to create the right temperature for the fish.

## Fish Health

Check fin rots (bacterial disease).

Take non-iodized salt and give it a salt bath for 20 seconds and put it in holding tank. Tilapia needs just only once is needed. But for carp/catfish you might have to give salt batch more than once. Potassium Permagnate can be used for last resort for serious disease (about 4gms for 1000 liters.). Don't add too much as it strips the oxygen in the water and hurts the fish. 

### Salting the Fish

1 kg per 1000 liters of water. Use pool salt, as table salt has iodine on it. Always salt the new fish you are bringing into your system for 5 days. Alternate salt and fresh water. So three days of salt and 2 days of fresh water.
