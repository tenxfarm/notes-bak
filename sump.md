The Sump is the heart of the system. It is like a grand central station, where all water comes in and all water exists. 

The Sump ideally can be build under ground, below the farm to save space. It needs to have 3 pumps (one which pumps to the overhead tank, one that is switched off and is just backup, one DC pump that is plugged in and will be tripped by either the fail switch or the reverse flat switch). It can also have an stainless steal protective caging around the pump, and K1s in the tank, to enable bio filtration. 

> Note: Biofiltration with K1s is a good hack, but that means it will also need aeration.

The sump can be built out of concrete. And needs to be large enough to take the water from floating beds, media beds and the fish tank. But this would be practically not possible, so if it can hold 50% of the water then it is good enough. 

In case we want to capture the nutrient loss if the sump overflows, we can have a backup sump to take in the overflowing water, similar to UVI system.
