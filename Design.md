Before we can start operations we need a base setup. This setup needs to be modular and self contained, so that we can replicate it to scale without worrying about existing systems.

## DESIGN EXERCISE CRITERIA

You will be required to submit a drawing/sketch of an Aquaponics Design. It should be a design for a mid range home system or a small commercial system. Accompanying the design should be an explanation of the parameters you assessed and justification for decisions. You will also need to provide a management plan which could be submitted to a client.

You are not required to submit green house/glasshouse designs, or lighting, or solar plans. Include notes on them, if they are relevant to your design.

## SITE MAP

Choose a real site and note the actual parameters of it. Location, aspect, water access, electricity access, vehicle access, size, slope. Find the sun angles in winter and summer. Is there anything blocking the sun path? (Shade from decidious trees may be a positive in hot climates). Draw these on a site map showing the footprint of your system.

Ground water level. 

## INVESTIGATE AND RECORD

### What is the water quality like?

Water Source: Lake, Bore water, Rain Water

pH level
Total Chlorine 
TSC

Near industrial area, so need to check on other heavy metal contamination.

Is the power supply reliable?
Reliable power supply. 230V AC 3 Phase.

What back up systems will you have in place?
DC batteries. 
Float Switch on the overhead tank.
Relay switch on the power line.
DC Pump for the fish tank (can we isolate? If we are using gravity)

What species of fish are suitable for your climate and what are available, or permitted to be grown?
Tilapia and Catfish. Both are available and permitted to be grown.

Will you need to heat the system?
No

Will you have a greenhouse? How big will it be ?
Yes. 10m by 30m

How much produce do you require what will you grow?
Need to do the math

How many fish do you want to harvest per week?


Demonstrate the relationship between the fish quantity and the number and type of beds.


How many of media beds, DWC, towers and wicking beds will you have, to obtain the yield you want.

What will the beds be constructed of? 
Fiberglass

What are your tanks made from?
Fiberglass


What pumps and air blowers will you use?


## SKETCH /DIAGRAM OF AQUAPONICS SYSTEM
Draw the plumbing, waterflows, tanks and beds in a configuration which is suitable for your site. Indicate the pumps and air blower positions.

## MANAGEMENT PLAN
Write a brief management plan for the system for a client to follow. Start with the cycling and then outline regular procedures to be carried out for management and maintenance checks. eg. How will you adjust your pH in the system?

### Cycling the System

Use without fish cycling.

1. Setup the system
2. Plant some sacrificial lettuce heads in the media bed.
3. Add some ammonia source (Liquid Ammonia). 
4. Add ammonia 1 tb spoon per 1000 liters in the fish tank only (not all system).
5. Let the water circulate for few hours
6. Test the water and continue till it becomes 2-4 ppm ammonia in the system. If it goes more than 6 ppm, then stop for 24 hours till it goes back down
7. 1-2 days later start testing for nitrites. Depends on weather conditions. In summer time it might take 2-4 weeks to cycle. In winter it might take 3 months. 
8. Continue to add ammonia, till Nitrates appear. If Nitrates are between 5-10ppm then stop. 

### Regular Checks

#### Daily
##### pH level
If pH trends down it is good. If it hits 6.4 pH, then boost it up with buffering agent. Hydrated Lime/garden lime (calcium carbonate) (40 grams) + Potassium hydroxide or potassium bicarbonate (20 grams) + Epsom Salt (Magnesium Sulfate (10 grams). Add to the furthest point. Go to furthest grow bed at the auto siphon point. Check pH after 24 hours and repeat to bring it up to 7.0 pH

If it goes about 7.0 pH, then you will have to add some acidic agent to bring it back down. 

Eyeball for pest. No leaf rot. 

roots clean

##### Temperature
If it gets too hot, then use fans.

##### EC

##### Dry gravel at the top of the media bed
If not dry could indicate poor draining. Replace the gravel media. 

#### Weekly
Ammonia, Nitrate, Nitrite test (Be careful to follow instructions correctly especially for nitrite test)
If nitrites goes over 60 ppm, then add more plants or reduce fish food.

Outlet valves for all floating raft beds to check for root clogs
Midia bed siphon check

Fish Health: Oil on texture, gills disease (pinkish red tinge), no fin rot, no lesion.  

Rock salt (non iodized salt) 20 second for the fish. And in holding tank. Potassium permagnate to kill disease (4-5 grams per 1000 liters). It is photo sensitive so needs to be done within 10 minutes. Don't use the hatchery water.

Harvesting fish fish density

Mineralization tank 

#### Monthly
Water draining of media bed. If auto siphon goes off too quickly, it indicates clogging.
DWC bottom slug accumulation. 
slug brush

#### Others
Once every two years change/clean the gravel in the media beds.
