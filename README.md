# Tenx Farm Setup

The idea is to setup a farm in a key city in India, such as Bangalore. The focus of this farm, is to learn aquaponics and implement technology and process innovation to improve productivity, yield, efficiency. Also, this will be a model farm and the primary pitch to increase the adoption of this technology. Therefore, the setup cost and setup time needs to be minimized. 

I will break this into three parts:

1. Setup
	1. [[Setup company]]
	2. [[Design]] the farm for a 1 acre land
	3. [[Sunk Cost]]
2. Operations
	1. [[Process Flow]]
