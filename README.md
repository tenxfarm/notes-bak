# Tenx Farm Setup

## Why Aquaponics?

1. Food Purity (no chemicals)
2. Food Security (local food. Covid for instance put pressure on food supply chain)
3. Food sovereignty (who owns the food supply)
4. Food Cost is lower at scale.
5. Multi-crop (even root vegetables are possible using [[wicking beds]])
6. Multiple income streams.

## Why Aquaponics in India
1. It can be done in all sorts of weathers with protective greenhouses
2. The productivity gains over the long run is similar to [[Hydroponics]], without the hassles of daily monitoring. Extremely hardy system. 
3. The [[Water]] requirements is bare minimum, compared to [[Hydroponics]]. In India water is the biggest crisis for farmers.
4. The GDP per capita for Agriculture has grown very slowly, and so unlocking the potential gain in GDP per capita in agriculture is easier. 
5. Atmanirbar play, food security play, socio-environment friendly play, technology play, VC play, Mudra loans play, subsidies play, exporting tech to near by countries play.

The goal is to make sure the cost of production for high quality organic food is cheaper than the production of low quality vegetables. 

## Tenx Improvements

A good inspiration for re-imagining farming is from Elon Musk's way of looking at Space X.

| Item | Status Quo | Goal |
|------|-------------|------|
|Setup Time | 6-8 months | 30 days |
|Setup cost | Rs. 4 crores per acre | Rs. 40 lakhs/acre |
|Water requirement (land based) | 100% | 10% of what is required|
|Labor | 100% | 10%|
|Other resources (tools, fertilizers etc.)| 100% | 10%|
|Yield | 100% | 500%|

The idea is to setup a farm in a key city in India, such as Bangalore. The focus of this farm, is to learn aquaponics and implement technology and process innovation to improve productivity, yield, efficiency. Also, this will be a model farm and the primary pitch to increase the adoption of this technology. Therefore, the setup cost and setup time needs to be minimized. 

Once we are able to hit these numbers, open it up to friends and family who have land but don't have the time/patience to get an aquaponics farm. Target those with at least 1-2 acre land, enough money and would think of it as lifestyle to own a farm, more than profit. 

End to end consulting and construction for them. From figuring out all the process (applications to govt., registering company, setting up farm, operation manual for farm, and to selling the produced vegetables via our platform). 


## Basics

Best of [[Aquaculture]] + [[Hydroponics]].

We don't have to dispose of the water. It has no synthetic chemicals. It is suitable for most fresh water species fish. Can't use agriculture chemicals. If you cheat, the fish die. So it is like self-audited.

System contains earth worms. Releases locked up nutrients. Earth worms in the [[Media Bed]]. 

I will break this into three parts:

1. Setup
	1. [[Setup company]]
	2. [[Design]] the farm for a 1 acre land
	3. [[Sunk Cost]]
2. [[Operations]]
	1. [[Process Flow]]
	2. [[Variable cost]]
3. Scaling
