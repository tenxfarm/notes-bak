# Tenx Farm Setup

## Why Aquaponics?

1. Food Purity (no chemicals)
2. Food Security (local food. Covid for instance put pressure on food supply chain)
3. Food sovereignty (who owns the food supply)
4. Food Cost

## Why Aquaponics in India
1. It can be done in all sorts of weathers with protected greenhouses
2. 

## Basics

Best of [[Aquaculture]] + [[Hydroponics]].

We don't have to dispose of the water. It has no synthetic chemicals. It is suitable for most fresh water species fish. Can't use agriculture chemicals. If you cheat, the fish die. So it is like self-audited.

System contains earth worms. Releases locked up nutrients. Earth worms in the [[Media Bed]]. But how?



The idea is to setup a farm in a key city in India, such as Bangalore. The focus of this farm, is to learn aquaponics and implement technology and process innovation to improve productivity, yield, efficiency. Also, this will be a model farm and the primary pitch to increase the adoption of this technology. Therefore, the setup cost and setup time needs to be minimized. 



I will break this into three parts:

1. Setup
	1. [[Setup company]]
	2. [[Design]] the farm for a 1 acre land
	3. [[Sunk Cost]]
2. [[Operations]]
	1. [[Process Flow]]
	2. [[Variable cost]]
3. Scaling
