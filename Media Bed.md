MEdia bed does the job of filtering and housing bacteria. They are stones, pretty big like rough soil.

They have worms, microbes, beneficial bacteria. The bacterial action takes place in media bed or bio filters. 

Lot of surface area for bacteria to cling to and for a way to water to move past this.

The breakdown of these solids to what the plants can use is [[mineralization]]. It occurs in all dark wet surfaces.
