The process of allowing naturally occurring bacteria and other microbes do their job of converting fish waste to usable plant food. 

Basic Nutrient Input into the system comes from the [[Fish Food]]. 

Fish food -> Fish poop -> Bacteria -> Plants

Source of ammonia from Fish poop, unused fish food and gills of the fish. Ammonia is not goof for the fish.

## Processing the ammonia

Naturally occurring bacteria: Nitrosomonas Bacteria.

Ammonia -> Nitrite 

Nitrite is more poisonous to the fish than ammonia. 

Nitrobacter bacteria converts nitrite to nitrates. 

Nitrates is good for the plants. Plants use them up and clean water is returned back to the fish.

A great place for these residential bacteria to live is [[Media Bed]]. They live in all wet dark places in contact with water. Media Bed, inside of pipe work, walls of fish tank, under side of the raft, walls of the raft beds. 

There are other beneficial bacteria. 

Is Nitates bad for humans? At that level we have in the system no. Most likely 60mg per liter. 300 mg/lt is bad.
