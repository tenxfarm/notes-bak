The process of allowing naturally occurring bacteria and other microbes do their job of converting [[Fish]] waste to usable plant food. 

Basic Nutrient Input into the system comes from the [[Fish Food]]. 

[[Fish]] food -> [[Fish]] poop -> Bacteria -> Plants

Source of ammonia from [[Fish]] poop, unused fish food and gills of the fish. Ammonia is not goof for the fish.

## Processing the ammonia

Naturally occurring bacteria: Nitrosomonas Bacteria.

Ammonia -> Nitrite 

Nitrite is more poisonous to the fish than ammonia. 

Nitrobacter bacteria converts nitrite to nitrates. 

Nitrates is good for the plants. Plants use them up and clean water is returned back to the fish.

A great place for these residential bacteria to live is [[Media Bed]]. They live in all wet dark places in contact with water. [[Media Bed]], inside of pipe work, walls of fish tank, under side of the raft, walls of the raft beds. 

There are other beneficial bacteria. 

Is Nitates bad for humans? At that level we have in the system no. Most likely 60mg per liter. 300 mg/lt is bad.

When you first start the system the beneficial bacteria need to be in place in the system, so the fish don't die. Two ways to do this:

1. Cycling without fish (better for first time people)
2. Cycle with fish

## Cycling without fish

We have built the fish tanks, the media bed. The water is moving. 

1. Dosing the system. 
2. Plant some plants (sacrificial plants like lettuce heads). The plants are able to take ammonia if it builds up in the system.
	1. **How Many Plants should we place? **
3. False source of ammonia. 
	1. Liquid Ammonia
	2. Ammonium Chloride
	3. [[Urea]] is not recommended.
	4. Human urine (100% of pure ammonia)
4. Test kit for ammonia, nitrites, nitrate. Fresh water test kit is recommended. 
5. Add ammonia 1 tb spoon per 1000 liters in the fish tank only (not all system).
6. Let the water circulate for few hours
7. Test the water and continue till it becomes 2-4 ppm ammonia in the system. If it goes more than 6 ppm, then stop for 24 hours till it goes back down
8. 1-2 days later start testing for nitrites. Depends on weather conditions. In summer time it might take 2-4 weeks to cycle. In winter it might take 3 months. 
9. Continue to add ammonia, till Nitrates appear. If Nitrates are between 5-10ppm then stop.

## Sweet Spot

When nitrites = nitrates. This is where you add the fish. 

Use the pdf record sheet to fill every day. When you add the fish, the system becomes dynamic. The plants that you placed in the beginning, you will see them get healthy.
