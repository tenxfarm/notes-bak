# pH

## What causes the pH to remain high?

Limestone content in your gravel media. (Test your media for limestone content.)

Carbonate hardness, or carbonate alkalinity is a measure of the alkalinity of water caused by the presence of carbonate (CO32-) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) anions.

## What if the pH starts to trend UP?

In Aquaponic systems with media beds this indicates....

1. Anaerobic pockets in the grow beds somewhere.
2. A different group of bacteria have taken up residence and are reversing the system.
3. Best method for lowering - Nitric, muriatic or phosphoric acid

## Increasing pH in the system

We can [[buffer up pH]], which will also add the nutrients that are difficult to find in aquaponics. 

## Testing pH
### Reagent kits (liquid)

### Strip tests
It is low cost, but not accurate and can't test below 6.0 pH.

### Electronic

Best brand: Blue Lab Digital test equipment. It can test pH, EC and temperature. pH testers to be accurate need to compensate for temperature.
