# Plant Nutrient

The primary source of nutrient for the entire system comes from fish food. And fish food is made for fish. The [[nutrient density]] is dependent on the type of the plants and the size of the system.

There are three things that doesn't naturally come into aquaponics system: Iron, Potassium and Calcium. These don't come from fish food.

## Types of nutrients

1. Non-Mineral Nutrients
2. Mineral Nutrients (Macro and Micro Nutrient)

### Non-Mineral Nutrients

1. Hydrogen
2. Oxygen
3. Carbon

With Sun, Oxygen and Water - Photosynthesis.

### Macro-Nutrients
1. Nitrogen (This is in abundance, if [[Cycling The System]] is done correctly)
2. Phosphorous (some difficulty)
3. Potassium (some difficulty)
4. Calcium (some difficulty)
5. Magnesium
6. Sulfur


### Micro-Nutrients
1. Boron
2. Copper
3. Iron (shortage in aquaponics)
4. Chloride
5. Manganese
6. Molybdenum
7. Zinc

## Identifying Nutrient Deficiency

Shortage of iron, phosphorous and calcium. 


Tomatoes are great plans to show the right type of deficiency.

The above shows a classic case of calcium deficiency.

## Fixing Deficiency

1. Seaweed Extract (shotgun approach)
2. Power Feed (seaweed + fish emulsion)

3. Chemical way: Trace Elements
4. Purist: Make compost tea and add it to the system
5. Buffering up the system

Add 120ml per 2 days per 2500 liters running thro' the floating raft beds. System water color will become a bit dark, but it will get cleared up in a few days. 

Chelated iron EDDHA 6% is a good stable source of iron. This means it breaks down easily without leaving a residue behind. It does however give a red pigmention to the water.
