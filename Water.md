# Water Requirement

# Water Sources

Municipal Water
Lake/Creek Water
Rain Water
Bore well water
Reverse Osmosis

Chlorine and Chloramine need to be tested. Need to test total chlorine and not just chlorine.

## Degassing Top Up Water
Holding Tank + Bubbler (Airstone) for 24 hours

Chloromine is often used in place of chlorine and it is longer lasting; however it kills [[Fish]] as well as bacteria. Chloromine can be eliminated by passing the water under a UV light which breaks it down into ammonia and chlorine. The chlorine can be bubbled off and the beneficial bacteria will process the ammonia.

Passing the water through an activated carbon filter will also remove the chloromine. It is expensive as it needs to be replaced from time to time.

## Rain water
Rain Water as long as it is not acid rain. It might need pH adjusters. [[Greenhouse]] to rainwater collector.

## Bore water
Variety of problems. Acidic or Alkaline Need to test it. If it is hard, then you need to treat it heavily. And if you add acid, then it adds salt. Salt changes Electrical Conductivity (EC).

## Lake

Could be contaminated. Especially if near industrial area. 

# Flow Rate

There are three loops:

Sump -> [[Fish]] Tank -> Swirl Filter -> Sump

Sump -> Media Beds -> Sump

Sump -> Floating Raft Beds -> Sump

Need to regulate the three flows using same [[Pump]].

![[Pasted image 20200927052134.png]]

First regulate the [[Media Bed]] as it can only handle what the [[Auto Siphon]] can handle.

Then regulate the floating raft bed.

Then what ever capacity is left use it for the [[Fish]] tank. Maximum flow to be available for the [[Fish]] tank. As [[Fish]] loves moving water. And the high flow water is good for filter systems.

Minimum flow we want to go thro' our raft system is 400 liters per hour. Get a ten liter bucket and a stop watch. Doesn't matter the raft bed. You can keep it a bit higher than that. 

The [[Media Bed]], the c1/3rd of capacity is water. The [[Auto Siphon]] works between 3-9 liters per minute. 

Depending on the capacity of the [[Pump]], rest goes to [[Fish]] Tank. A good rule of thumb, if you can put half the water in the [[Fish]] tank in one hour, then it is good.

How big should the Sump be? Should allow for all of the auto-siphon stops or the [[Pump]] fails. 

## Swirl Filter 

Water needs to be there for 20 minutes.

If you are going to put 1500 liters per hour, then it needs to be at least 500 liters.
