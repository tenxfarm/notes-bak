Mineralization is the way to ensure more nutrients are squeezed out of the fish waste. There are a lot of nutrients in fish waste apart from nitrites which the plant need. The [[Settlement Tank]] filters out all the solids. The water rich in ammonia then goes to the media beds and [[sump]] where the biofilters convert them to nitrites. But over a period of time a lot of these solids get settled down in the [[Settlement Tank]].

Having a cone shaped [[Settlement Tank]], with all these wasted collected in the bottom and released once a while into a mineralization tank will allow us to collect this solid nutrient rich waste. Add in some molasses (sugar) and aeration to this tank and you will have compost tea, which you can drain it back into the system slowly.

## Flow

Water with solids coming from fish tank go to the [[Settlement Tank]].

It flows into the settlement tank

The pipe on the right facing downward is the input from the fish tank. The pipe in the center is what goes to the sump. The height of this, controls the height of the water in the fish tank. The hole in the bottom is what goes to the mineralization tank. The mineralization tank is not connected to the system, in the sense that water is not flowing thro' it always.

It is run in batches.

After about a week of running the settlement tank, 50mm (2 inches) worth of solid slush is settled down. At this point opening the valve that connects the bottom hole of the settlement tank to the mnieralization tank, will force the slush to go thro' to the mineralization tank due to the weight of the water above in the settlement tank.

After draining the slush, as clean water comes out into the mineralization tank, turn the valve off. Now the mineralization tank is cut off from the main system. 

Add some molasses (a big cup of it) and turn on the air valve to aerate it for **48 hours**.

As the right conditions are set (sugar + aeration), the beneficial aerobic bacteria grow

Adding K1s to it, will also help the bacteria growth as it increases the surface area to which the bacteria can cling on. 

After 48 hours, we switch off aeration, to let the solids settle and we drain half way of this back to the sump. We do half way, to ensure solids don't enter the sump.

The pipe on the far left is the aeration pipe. It has an air stone/air disk right to the bottom.
