# Nutrient Density

The primary source of nutrients into an aquaponics system is [[Fish Food]]. 

## Fish feed per sq. meter of growing bed

| Type of Plant | Fish Feed per sq m| No. of Plants per sq. m|
|-----|----|----|
| Lettuce/Leafy Green|  10-15 gm | 30 |
|Okra-Egg Plant etc. |25-30 gm| 6 plants|
|Tomatoes|40 gm| 6 plants|

## Fish to eat that much Fish

100 sq meter beds with a mix of raft and media beds 6:1 ratio:
85 sq m of rafts @10-15 gms per sq m = 1,275 gms food
15 sq m of media beds @40 gms per sq m = 630 gms food.

= 2kg(rounded off) per day of fish food required.

It is a simple matter of having enough fish to eat 2kg of high quality 38-40% protein fish feed a day. That will change from species to species of fish and also on the maturity of the fish.

Typically, fish will consume around 1% to 2 % of their body weight in fish food per day. This varies depending on fish species. (The feed consumption of any individual system will be determined by careful observation and recording.)

> So, to get the 2kg of fish food eaten per day assuming
2% body weight consumption.
2x100/2 =100kg fish

[[stocking density]] at a commercial rate of max 70 kg per cu m then we will need fish tank, or tanks of a total volume 2 cu m (2000 litres) to grow the 100kg of fish.

Different fish have different conversion ratio of the feed:
