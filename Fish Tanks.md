# Fish Tank

The fish tank can be any size depending on the system they need to support. 

## Material

1. Wood and liner
2. Fiberglass (best as it is inert and has long life)
3. Stainless Steel
4. Poly Tank (easy availability)

The size of the tank would depend on the [[stocking density]] and the [[nutrient needs]] for different plants and the number of plants.
