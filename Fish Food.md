# Feeding tilapia from fingerlings to harvest size

## Tilapia Feeding Charts

There are three feeding charts presented below. These are only applicable to pure strain food grade Blue tilapia and pure strain food grade Nile tilapia. They show the exact amount to feed for each day of the grow out period. All you have to do is determine exactly how much 100 of your tilapia weigh, and feed the exact amount shown for that day. Then you just follow along with each subsequent day until you reach one pound. You only have to weigh your tilapia once, because the next days weight is already calculated. This is why you use AquaMax. The growth at any given size is predictable by the amount fed the previous day!

If there is more, or less, than 100 fingerlings, we will need to scale up or scale down the feed. 

The feeding charts below will take 194 days to complete. You can reduce the total time to 180 days or even less by feeding slightly more at the beginning of each chart and then tapering off to match the weights at the end. This takes some practice and a watchful eye on water quality, but may be worth the effort to hit a specific harvest date. If you decide to accelerate the feeding charts in this manner, be sure to switch to the next food when your tilapia reach the final weight listed on each chart.

> For example: You can start the first chart by feeding an extra 9.45 grams of food on the first day, then reduce the extra amount by half a gram per day until your fish weigh 28 grams each. You can start the second chart by feeding an extra 28.4 grams then taper off by 1.2 grams per day until your fish weigh 57 grams each.

## Why Purina AquaMax?

Under optimal conditions and using only surface [[Aeration]], food grade blue [[tilapia]] can grow to one pound in as little as 240 days. If you breed your own tilapia, you can add another couple of weeks for egg incubation. Alternatively, if you buy your fingerlings from hatcheries, you can subtract about 46 days from the grow-out period, because that is the average age of the tilapia fingerlings that are shipped to customers. 

Purina AquaMax contains exact nutrients to get the fish to grow out in 240 days. Anything else will need more time.

## Economics

What's the point of saving money on food, if you have to feed your tilapia for an additional 100 days? The longer you feed your tilapia, the more they will cost per pound. And it not just the food cost, it's electricity, water treatment, filter media replacement, sterilizer longevity, chemical usage, as well as employee costs (or your own valuable time). These hidden costs add up quickly, and can make your own tilapia filets more expensive than store-bought retail.
