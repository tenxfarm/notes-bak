# Harvesting Fish

Turn off the inlet of the water and pump the water down. As the water pumps down clean the sides. As the water goes down, the fish tend to get spooked. So we need to [[calm the fish]] by adding in medicine. If we don't do this, some of them might die of stress. 

Harvest them and put them in a holding tank. 

Clean up the sides and pump the water back in to dilute the anesthetics. The fish will revive soon.
