# Backup System

Depending on the availability of electricity, the backup system should be designed. If regular power cuts are the norm, then the backup system should be capable of running the entire farm. In such cases, you will need diesel generators. But if electricity is fairly stable and power failures are one of events, then the backup system doesn't have to run the entire farm.

## Water flow
In the [[CHOP system]] there are three loops: 
1. [[sump]] -> Overhead Tank -> Media Bed -> [[sump]]
2. [[sump]] -> Overhead Tank -> Floating Raft Bed -> [[sump]]
3. [[sump]] -> Overhead Tank -> Fish Tank -> [[Settlement Tank]] -> [[sump]]

The  [[Media Bed]] will have water in them, that wouldn't have been drained by the [[Auto Siphon]]. The [[Floating Raft Beds]] will also have water below the pipe levels. 

However for the fish, the ammonia built up needs to be cleared out. So the water needs to be moved. So in this case there needs to be a back up dc motor that connects the [[sump]] to fish tank directly. There is no water pumped to overhead tank. As water to overhead tank would mean the water will also flow to media beds and floating raft beds, which we don't want.

### Back up Water Flow

[[sump]] -> Fish Tank -> [[Settlement Tank]] -> [[sump]]

## Air Flow
There is no requirement for aeration in Media Beds. In Floating Rafts the aeration at every 1.2m distance needs to be maintained. For the fish tank as well aeration needs to be maintained. 

## Backup System Components

### DC Pumps

Unlike the pumps used for the system normally, which is not submersible, the DC pump can be submersible pump, which is right inside the [[sump]] tank.

### Fail Switch

This is triggered when power goes out. This doesn't ensure the backup system is triggered due to other faults such as pump failure etc.
