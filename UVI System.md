# UVI System

Just like the CHOP system, the UVI system also requires only one pump. But unlike the three loops in CHOP system, in UVI system, there is only one loop.

## Components

1. 4 Fish tanks 7800 liters each
2. 2 Clarifiers 3800 liters each
3. 4 Filter tanks 700 liters each. Have fish net (can have K1s) which provides biofilteration. Issue is the fishnets needs to be cleaned every 2 days and it is a painful process.
4. 1 degassing tank to burn off/dissipate the gases that is built up in the system before it goes to growing beds.
5. Growing beds (214 sq meters total growing area -> 6 X 30m X 1.2m (300mm deep))
6. 1 Sump of 600 liters
7. Backup Sump aka base addition tank 200 liters. 
8. 24 airstones in each fish tank
9. 2 Pumps (one for back up).

## Water Requirement
Total water volume 110,000 liters in the system. 

## Land Area
500-600 sq meter of area. 1/8th of an Acre.

## Aeration
24 air stones in each fish tank.

3 air stones at [[degassing tank]]. 

1 air stone per 1.2 meters in the [[Floating Raft Beds]].

## Pump
1/2 horsepower transfer pumps are enough as it doesn't have to pump the water too far. Just from the sump to the fish tanks.

## Flow

Water from the fish tanks go to the calrifiers (settlement tanks).

![[assets/Pasted image 20201004045618.png]]

The partitions inside the clarrifiers enables solids getting filtered out as the water needs to fill chamber 1, then flow up the edge to chamber 2. And then edge out to chamber three to the filters.

Then the water from the clarifiers move to the two filteration tanks. Where the unfiltered solids adhere to the fish nets and then are further broken down by beneficial bacteria.

Then the water flows to the degassing tank, where it is aerated and degassed for gases that were built up in the filtration tank. When anaerobic bacteria get formed in the fish nets, the reverse process of what aerobic bacteria does happens and this produces methane which is not good for the plants or the fish.

The degassing tanks need fly screen nets, to ensure any baby fish is caught. As if the baby fish ends up in the floating raft beds, then it will end up destroying the roots of the plants.

The water then goes to the grow beds. And then finally to the sump, which then pumps it back to the fish tank. Two floating raft beds are connected together, to reduce piping. Water enters from one raft, goes all the way to the end and then enters next raft.

## Flow rates

Fish tank: 1300 liters per hour thro' each fish tank
[[Settlement Tank]]/Clarifiers: Limit is 3800 liters X 3 per hour. Anything under that is fine as we want the water to be in it for at least 20 minutes.
Floating rafts: 3 hours to flow thro' them. About 1300 liters per hour. Minimum flow rate 400 liters per hour.

## Mineralization

Small bucket like device which collects the slug from the settlement tank every 2 days.

It follows the simple [[mineralization]] process. 

## Base Addition Tank

This can be used for adding nutrients (buffering up pH and adding iron, potassium and calcium). We need to add this as far away from the fish tank, as it will give a pH shock to the Fish. 

## Yield
500 sq meter UVI system produces this:

Lettuce: 1404 cases/year, 30 heads per case, 27 cases per week. 
Basil: 5 MT/year
Okra: 2.9 MT/year

Tilapia fish: 5 MT/year -> 580 kg every 6 weeks, 160 kg/M3/year

Stocking rate:
Niles, 77 Fish/ M3
Reds, 154 Fish/M3

## Issue
1. In case of power failure, all the systems are connected and this will affect all the systems. In CHOP system, there are three loops
2. No media beds or wicking beds possible. This means the crop selection is limited. 
3. As there is no media bed, need a bio filter tank, which means cleaning up the fish nets is an additional hassle.
