## Protective Farming

1. Protect against weather. 
2. Protect against rodents
3. Protect against [[Pest]] (locust etc.)

We want closed/controlled environment agriculture (CEA). A good model is Agriplast's Prefab Dome Shaped Climate Control Greenhouse For Agriculture: https://www.indiamart.com/proddetail/climate-control-greenhouse-22296061248.html

It is Rs. 1,550/Sq Meter and minimum order quantity is 2000 Sq Meter which is half acre. The half acre will cost 1550 * 2000 = Rs. 31 lakhs.

This excludes the tiling we need to get done at the base. We need to check if the 2 feet high brick wall is included and if the fans are included. If the fans are included will the power control unit for the fans also be given?

## Pros:
It is in Hosur and so it can immediately be procured as the farm is in Bangalore and quite close to Hosur. Also in future any maintenance for the greenhouse can easily be done as the vendor is close by. 

## Cons
The critical part that I am worried about is, this is the biggest sunk cost and we have no control over it. Without controlling or bringing this cost down, bringing the setup cost down for a 1 acre farm is highly unlikely as the greenhouse alone will take Rs. 62 lakhs.
