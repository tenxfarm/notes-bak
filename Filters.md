Swirl Filter Tank or Settlement Tank

Pick up a lettuce head. If roots are clean then the filter system is good. 

A gravel bed is both a mechanical and bio filter. But as system grows you need filter.

When you have fish density of 5 kgs per cu meter, you need filter. 10 fish per 1000 litters. It is solids filter. Not a bio-filter.

20 minute rule for a settlement tank. [[Pump]] it at a rate that the water stays for 20 minutes. For a 750 lt tank, 2250 lt water can be pumped thro' the tank per hour. Mechanical Filtration.

The volume of water moving thro' the fish tank is controlled by the size of the settlement tank.
