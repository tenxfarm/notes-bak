# Buffer up pH 

## pH trends down in a balanced aquaponics system.

What makes it trend down?

This describes chemically what occurs during nitrification (the conversion of ammonia to nitrate):
NH 3 + O 2 → NO 2− + 3H + + 2e −
NO 2− + H 2 O → NO 3− + 2H + + 2e −
As can be seen from 1 and 2 above, when 1 mole of ammonia (NH 3 ) is converted fully to 1 mole of nitrate (NO 3 ), the outcome produces 5 Hydrogen ions in total (the 5 x H + ). pH is a measure of the ratio between hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH). So, the reaction causes H's to be released and this means the ratio of H to OH in the water is in favor of H. pH is a measure of this H to OH ratio and so if there are more H's, the pH drops and becomes acidic.

## How do we correct the lowering pH?

We need to “buffer” the system UP by using a Hydroxide or Carbonate compound. Happily this is good for the plants in many ways.

By using Hydrated Lime we use a powerful buffer and at the same time we have added Calcium to our
system. Another in the calcium family is Calcium Carbonate

We can use Potassium Hydroxide or Potassium Bicarbonate. (Obviously we are adding potassium in this process.)

When a buffer is added (like OH or CO3), these buffers scavenge the H's and make the ratio go back toward neutral and this raises the pH by removing the overbearing H's form the water, thus making the ratio of H to OH equal when the pH is 7. Above 7, the ratio of OH is higher than H's.
