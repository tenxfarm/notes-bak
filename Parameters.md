# Parameters

1. pH - Acid/Base balance of the system 
2. Temperature (water and air) 
3. Dissolved Oxygen
4. Electrical Conductivity

## pH

Power of Hydrogen. Hydrogen (H+) changes pH from basic (pH > 7.0) to acidic (ph < 7.0).

It is the most important parameter to check. It affects the fish, plants and the bacteria. 

Plant nutrient uptake is better if it is slightly acidic. You might have a lot of minerals, but the plant doesn't take it up if the pH is high. Plants love 5 pH. But Fish don't.

Fish prefer pH between 7 to 8. They want the pH of water to be same as their body. The fish can adapt, provided the changes are slow. So don't let the pH go below 6.2.

The ideal range: 6.2 - 7.0 pH

### pH trends down

Potassium, Calcium and Iron don't come easily into the aquaponics system. As fish food is the only source of input to the system. And fish food doesn't contain them.

As pH goes down, we need to kick it back up. This can be done with hydrated lime, which is good for pH and also good for getting the 1 of the nutrients that are generally deficit in aquaponics.

It is just ground rock treated with water. It adds calcium. Since it is alkaline. It needs to be added as far from the fish as possible in the system. 1 tb per 1000 lts of fish tank volume.

Read the pH after a day. Start doing this when it is 6.4 pH level. Do it a few times, till you get it closer to pH 7. Keeping records will let you know the cycle of frequency to do.

Dolomite lime can be used in conjunction with calcium carbonate which adds magnesium into the system as well.

Every fourth time it is good to use a potassium product. Potassium carbonate, or potassium bicarbonate.(found in brewers supply stores, also called potash ). Add 1 tablespoon per 1000 litres. It buffers the pH and adds potassium to the system. Both calcium and potassium bind the hydrogen ions and they are no longer free in the water, thus raising the pH.

If a pattern occurs, where pH starts to take a lot longer to drop down, levels off and starts trending upwards, this indicates a problem in the grow beds. Look for a blockage where roots have created a stagnant area, where water is not circulating and oxygen exchange is not occurring. In these circumstances anerobic bacteria is developing, which converts nitrates back into ammonia, thus raising the pH.

### Buffering + Nutrient Mix:

Hydrated Lime/garden lime (calcium carbonate) (40 grams) + Potassium hydroxide or potassium bicarbonate (20 grams) + Epsom Salt (Magnesium Sulfate (10 grams). Add to the furthest point. Go to furthest grow bed at the auto siphon point.  

Potassium bicarbonate can also be sprayed on plants. Good for killing some pests. 

## GRAVEL & pH Test
The choice of media material must be considered for its effect on pH. Gravel with limestone shouldnâ€™t be used as it is heavily alkaline and will continually effect the pH. To test the gravel leave some pieces in white vinegar for a several hours. If there are continual signs of effervescence, then the vinegar is reacting with the gravel giving off CO2 and it is limestone.

## WATER SOURCES
In planning the siting of an Aquaponics system, the availabilty of a reliable good source of water is essential.

### TOWN WATER
Town water may have chlorine or chloromine in it. Many city councils have this information on their web sites or you can ring and ask. Chlorine is added to water to kill bacteria, so it must be eliminated. Fill a separate tank with water and apply airstones and oxygenate it for 24 hours. This will disperse the chlorine out of the water and can be used to top up the water in the system.



### How to measure
Strips, digital meters, water test. 

Ph Reagent Test:
3 drop of reagent. It reads only till 6.0 and above. So if pH drops below that, it will show 6.

Bluelab digital instrument. $240. Two probes

![[Pasted image 20200927032203.png]]

pH probe. The probe must always be kept wet. If it dries out. Then the system is useless. 
Temperature and EC probe.

Nutrient in the tool is basically EC. 

## Water Testing

### Ammonia test

2 Part test. 

1. Wash the vial 
2. 5 ml in the vial. Flick the excess the water.
3. Give the bottle 1 (reagent) give it good shake
4. Add 8 drops.
5. Cap the vial and give it a good shake for 10-15 seconds.
6. Give bottle 2 a good shake
7. Add 8 drops. Give it a good shake
8. Get the reading almost immediately.
9. Check with the ammonia color chart.

### Nitrite Test 

1 part test. 5 drops. 

### Nitrate 

Nitrate is very critical to follow instructions. 
2 part test. 10 drops. 30 seconds shake. Bottle 2 10 drops. Shake 30 seconds. Leave it stand for 5 minutes. 

If nitrates are high, plant more more plants or cut down on fish food. 

Cycling the system:
Need to test pH everyday. 
Ammonia everyday
Nitrites 
Nitrates

System is running
pH everyday
Ammonia, Nitrites and Nitrates once a week
