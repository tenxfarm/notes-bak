Higher DO as the bacteria/fish need more oxygen. [[tilapia]] is a hardy fish which can survive low dissolved oxygen.

Dissolved oxygen (in the water) is critical to fish, plant and bacterial health.
1. As temperature of the water rises DO will fall
2. Maximum amount possible is about 10 mg/l
3. The minimum for cold water fish (trout) 6.0mg/l
4. **The minimum for fish is about 5.0 mg/l**
5. The minimum for plant roots is about 2.5 mg/l
6. The minimum for bacteria is about 2.0 mg/l


[[Fish]] are the limiting factor when it comes to oxygen because their requirements are the higher. D.O. be kept above 5.0 mg/L at ALL times. Aeration and water movement (splashing) assist in D.O. maintenance. Air pumps, blowers, water movement
