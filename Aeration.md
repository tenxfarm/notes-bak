Air will also go to degassing tank, if you have chlorine filtering holding tank.

## Systems that require Aeration

1. Floating Raft Beds (every 1.2 meters)
2. The fish tank (always on. With a backup aeration system)
3. Mineralization tank (when mineralizing)
4. Degassing tank (if you have it 24 hours per batch of water)
5. Sump (if you are adding K1s and making it into a bio filter)

Disturb the surface of the water, by angling the pipes.
