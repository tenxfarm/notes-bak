## Tiling/Flooring
For smooth [[Operations]] and controlling the environment we will need to tile the entire farm base. Later rails can be added to the floor, to help with trolleys and movement of goods without damaging the tiles. 

### Key Questions
1. How much will it cost to tile (interlocks) 1 acre land?
2. Who does it? Which vendor?
3. How long does it take to get it done?
4. Will the media beds need an additional cement block for stability over these tiles?
5. Will we need to flatten the land?
