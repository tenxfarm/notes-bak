# Core system

The core system consists of [[Fish Tanks]], [[Media Beds]], [[Floating Raft Beds]], [[Sump]], [[Settlement Tank]], [[Pumps]]

## Extra Systems

[[Filter]], [[Heating]], [[Cooling]], [[Aeration]]

## Aquaponics Systems

1. DWC
2. Media Beds
3. NFT

### DWC (Deep water culture)

For a commercial setting this is the best as it has ease of planting and harvest.

#### Dimensions
1.2m X 30m. 
1m is 36 holes. 

[[DWC System]] needs to be raised and not on the ground. The advantages is better productivity for planting and harvesting and lower [[Pest]]. The closer to the ground the more the [[Pest]] risk.

900mm or waist height elevation is good. But that also means it has to be strong as there is a lot of water.

Temperature and PH is under control as there is a lot of water and that means more stability.

#### Disadvantages
1. Cost of construction, especially for raised
2. [[Aeration]] is required every 4 feet (1.2 meters)

### [[Media Beds]]

Media beds is necessary for all aquaponics systems as it is a massive nutrient bank. 

#### Dimensions
300 mm deep X 1.2 m wide X 5 m in length (this is the ideal length, it can be longer)
2/4 inch or 20 mm gravel is best. Smaller size will need more frequent servicing as the draining will not be efficient after some time. 
River gravel, normal gravel is good.
Clay pebbles (Hydrotons) as expensive, have low service life and not stable for tall plants. They also limit earthworm population as they are smaller in size and have less room for earthworms to move.
> Limestone free. Limestone in gravel will spike the PH up and will be difficult to control. 

#### Advantages
1. Solid separation filter. Any solid that escapes the settlement tank is food for the microbes. This also helps clean the water that enters the raft beds.
2. Solids mineralization. It releases more locked nutrients.
3. Biofilter. The beneficial bacteria reside here as the surface area is a lot.
4. Earthworm home. Earthworms reduce solid matter by 80%.

#### Disadvantages
1. Cost of construction. 1 cu m gravel weights about 1.3 tons. + water.
2. Maintenance (every 2 years change or clean the gravel)
3. Need to monitor PH carefully.

#### Cleaning/Changing

1. PH reading generally trends down. If it trends up, then it is time to clean. It means aerobic bacteria is not there and anaerobic bacteria pockets are growing.
2. Not draining properly. Auto-siphon stops before the water is drained

> Don't change all media beds at the same time. Have a 2-4 week staging period between each [[Media Bed]] change. This will ensure system is stable. Else ammonia will spike and fishes will die

### NFT (Nutrient Film Technique)

Used heavily in [[Hydroponics]]. But not suitable for Aquaponics as the solid wastes clog up the pipes. Bigger pipes lead to more failure points and water and nutrient leakages. Low cost, but lot of plumbing. Another big disadvantage is controlling the temperature as water moves thro' the pipes. 

## [[CHOP]] System:

Constant Height One [[Pump]]. This is good for a 30m X 10m wide 5000 hole system. Ensure the backup [[Pump]] is also hooked up and plumbed in. All outbound of water from the sump is by [[Pump]].

Constant height of water level in the fish tank. 

### There are thee main loops:

## Decoupling the [[Aquaculture]] and [[Hydroponics]] system in Aquaponics

![[Pasted image 20200927022745.png]]

As build up of nitrates happens, you need to dump water. So in order to salvage the dumped water, you can use a [[Hydroponics]] system near by

![[Pasted image 20200927022902.png]]

The idea is using a valve. If [[Pest]] happens, then you can use unnatural means in the [[Hydroponics]]. As the water doesn't come back to the fish.

Basically, you can stop the audit by the plants and the fish on each other.
