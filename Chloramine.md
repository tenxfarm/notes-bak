# Chloramine

Chloramine is a chemical compound of chlorine and ammonia. It does not dissipate or evaporate into the air as chlorine does. It is highly toxic and lethal to marine animals and fish. When in contact with organic materials in raw water, it creates toxic byproducts.

Chloramine (NH 2 Cl) is commonly used in municipal water as an alternative to chlorine. Chloramine is much more stable and does not dissipate as rapidly as free chlorine. Chloramine is formed by ammonia and chlorine being combined. Some chloramines could readily form in Aquaponics system water if you were to add chlorinated water straight from the tap to an Aquaponics system tank that already carried some free ammonia. If you cannot get a report from your water authority and you strongly suspect the presence of chloramines, obtain a test kit that is able to test for "total chlorine" or "combined chlorine," not for "free chlorine." A test for "free chlorine" would misleadingly read zero in chloraminated water.

## Removing Chloramine

Chloramines can be removed from your source water by,
1. Boiling and degassing. (not very practical for large quantities)
2. **Ultraviolet light. (Well established method of removal).**
3. Activated carbon filter. (pass the water through slowly)
4. Commercially available dechloramination products (some simply remove the chlorine, while others 'lock up' or detoxify remaining ammonia) 
5. It is best to treat any suspect water in a holding tank before using for top up in the Aquaponics system proper.
