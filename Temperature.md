## Temperature

## Water Temperature

Temperature of the water column is so important in Aquaponic systems.

Too hot and oxygen is lost. The water cannot hold as much oxygen.

Too low and the fish stop eating and the bacteria stop reproducing/ Loss of nutrient production -> loss of bacterial action.

Depending on [[fish]] species fish deaths can occur in out of range situations.

## Root zone temperatures

Food plants have an ideal root zone temp.
