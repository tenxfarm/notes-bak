For home use you don't really need a filter, as the [[Media Bed]] doubles up as a filter. But for commercial system you will need [[Filters]].

Swirl filter or settlement tank has 20 minute rule. Basically, we pump it at such a rate that the water remains in the tank for 20 minutes. So for a 750 lt tank, we can't pump more than 2250 liters of water per hour. This is basically a mechanical filter, using gravity. 

Basically the volume of the water flowing thro' the fish tank, depends on the size of the settlement tank. 

Can just be made of fiberglass, same as the floating raft beds. Has outer pipe that brings in the fish waste, has a central pipe that takes the water from the surface to the [[sump]]. There can also be a pipe at the bottom (in case the settlement tank is designed in a cone shape, aka clarifier) which can be connected to [[mineralization]] tank.
