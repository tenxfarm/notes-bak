A wicking bed can be used if we want to get into growing root vegetables. This will need compost and it will be split out from the main system. The watering for this will have to be a bit more manual.

Once the base pipe is laid out, ensure the bottom pipe has many slits for water to get out. And cover it up with [[gravel]].

The slotted pipe runs thro' the bottom:

Place gravel around the pipe so that the compost/roots don't clog the slots in the pipe.

Then place a netted cloth (similar to the medical dressings)

And then fill it up with compost. 

Water don't slow thro' this always. We turn it on and turn it off once a week. We will know when to fill it up with water, but looking down the pipe at the other end. Also can use a buoy sort of device at the other end which will let us know when to water.

Add a lot of earthworm. And keep topping it up every month and mix it up.
