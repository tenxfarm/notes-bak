# Land

## Ideal Land:
1. No less than 1.5 acres big
2. Preferably agriculture land. 
3. With good source of water (like bore water and stream/lake nearby)
4. With good electricity coverage
5. No blockage of the Sun
6. Preferably in/near Bangalore. 
7. Preferably own the land or lease it, not buy new land.


## Bangalore Land

1. 1.8 Acres. 
2. It is industrial zone. 
3. It is 100 meters from a lake. And has bore water available at low depth.
4. Electricity is available consistently.
5. No blockages to the sun.
6. About 30 km from Bangalore. Can play the rural development card also, if we choose to consider it as Kolar district.
7. The land is free and no need to pay lease or rent it. 

### Biggest concern:
Water. The 2016 tests by the municipality is quite scary. Two main things is total chloride and pH. The acceptable levels of pH for us is anywhere from 6.0 to 7.2. But here it can range from 5.5 to 9.0. Chloride due to chlorine can be [[degassed]]. But [[Chloramine]] would incur additional costs like UV treatment.  

Around 11 ground and 2 surface water samples were collected to assess the water quality. The ground water samples were drawn from the hand pumps and open wells of villages being used for domestic needs. Surface water samples were taken from major tanks / ponds.

#### Ground Water

1. The pH is varying from 7.27 to 8.04 indicating that all samples are in acceptable limits.
2. TDS levels are varying from 299 mg/l to 1157 mg/l. 4 samples are below the acceptable limit and remaining all samples were above acceptable limits but within the permissible limits.
3. Chloride levels are ranging from 35.2 mg/l to a maximum of 298 mg/l. 10 samples are below the acceptable limit and 1 sample is above the acceptable limit but within the permissible limit.
4. Hardness is varying from 115 mg/l to 608 mg/l, 5 samples are within the acceptable limit, 5 samples were above the acceptable limit but within the permissible limit and remaining 1 sample above the permissible limit.
5. The fluoride values are in the range of 0.52 mg/l to 0.84 mg/l indicating all samples are within the acceptable limits

#### Surface Water

1. pH was varying between 6.56 to 6.97
2. The total dissolved solids were in the range of 112 mg/l to 130 mg/l
3. The chlorides were in the range of 18 mg/l to 20 mg/l
4. The hardness is varying between 70 mg/l to 74 mg/l.
5. Fluoride content was in range of 0.22 mg/l to 0.25 mg/l
6. DO levels are varying from 4.3 mg/l to 4.5 mg/l
7. BOD levels are varying from 4.2 mg/l to 4.5 mg/l

Analysis of ground water samples were found to be within the acceptable limits. Few samples are above the acceptable limit but within the permissible limit. Hardness levels in one sample is above the permissible limits. Overall surface water samples are meeting the class â€˜D' norms as per IS: 2296-1992.

>The total water requirement for the industrial area will be 4200 KLD. This will be met by reusing treated water to the tune of 1753 KLD with a fresh water intake of 2447 KLD. The main source of water for the proposed project is Bore wells. Waste water generated from all the proposed units would be treated in a common effluent treatment plant. The expected waste water characteristics are **pH 5.5-9.0**; Oil & grease 20mg/l; TSS 100mg/l; TDS 2000-2500 mg/l; COD 1500 to 2000mg/l. The industrial and domestic effluents would be collected through separate drains and treated in CETP & CSTP respectively. Treated water is used for greenbelt development to the maximum extent along with industrial floor washing and cooling purpose.
