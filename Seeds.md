# Seeds

Two ways of getting seeds:
1. Buy them
2. Collect them

## Buy Seeds

Seeds can be procured from Karnataka Horticulture department. They can come in individual seeds or in pellet form.

Pellets are easier to plant (as they are easier to handle and don't require you to bury them in the medium (choir/perlite)), compared to individual tiny seeds. But they are bit more expensive compared to just getting seeds. Also pelletized seeds have higher germination rate.

## Collect Seeds
When you see a good crop (fast growing, high yield), instead of harvesting it, grow it out and collect the seeds. Even for lettuce etc. this can be done. 5 gen of seeds will be acclimatize to your environment.

### Collecting Tomato seeds:
Squeeze the seeds. Let them ferment for 2 days. Put them in a jar with water. Shake it. Those that sink is good. Leave them to dry. 

## Seedlings
You will need two trays. A holding tray, and a net pots tray. Fill the net pots with vermiculite/perlite. Place the seeds in each of them. And use the water from the fish tank.

Pour the water in the holding tray. The vermiculite will suck up the water using capillary effect and will change color. Pelletized seeds don't have to be buried. 

Check after two weeks, when the roots start to show out of the net pot that is when the seedlings are ready to be planted on the raft beds.
