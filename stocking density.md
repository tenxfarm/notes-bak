# Stocking Density

For a commercial system, 75 kgs of fish per cu meter (1000 liters) is possible. The only water you consider for stocking density is the water in the fish tank. 

## Dependent Variables
1. System Size (sq meter of growing area)
2. Plant Mix - [[nutrient density]]
3. Flow rates (control the nutrient going thro' the different systems)
4. Type of [[Fish]]


|Feeding Requirement | Stocking Density|
|------|-----|
|40 gm/sq meter| 62-70 kg fish per cubic m|

## Building up the stocking fish density

Let us take example of a 6 fish tank farm

The grow-out period for[[tilapia]] is 9 months. 9 months/6 tanks = 6 weeks. 

So every 6 weeks you will stock 1 tank. And the cycle will continue. When you put fingerling fish (small fish), till it grows, you will need to add seaweed extract.
